;; Author: Roland Walker walker@pobox.com
;; URL: https://github.com/rolandwalker/persistent-soft.el
;; Version: 0.8.1
;; Last-Updated: 27 Aug 2012
;; EmacsWiki: PersistentSoft
;; Keywords: data, extensions
;; Package-Requires: ((pcache "0.2.3"))

;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is a (trivial) wrapper around pcache.el, providing "soft"
;; fetch and store routines which never throw an error, but instead
;; return nil on failure.
;;
;; There is no end-user interface for this library.  It is only
;; useful from other Lisp code.
;;
;; The following functions are provided
;;
;;    persistent-soft-exists-p
;;    persistent-soft-fetch
;;    persistent-soft-flush
;;    persistent-soft-store
;;
;; To use persistent-soft, place the persistent-soft.el library
;; somewhere Emacs can find it, and add the following to your
;; ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;    (require 'persistent-soft)
;;
;; See Also
;;
;;    M-x customize-group RET persistent-soft RET
;;
;; Notes
;;
;;    Using pcache with a more recent version of CEDET gives
;;
;;       Unsafe call to `eieio-persistent-read'.
;;       eieio-persistent-read: Wrong type argument: class-p, nil
;;
;;    This library provides something of a workaround.
;;
;; Compatibility and Requirements
;;
;;    Tested only on GNU Emacs version 24.1
;;
;;    Uses if present: pcache.el (all operations are noops when
;;    not present)
;;
;; Bugs
;;
;;    Persistent-soft is a wrapper around pcache which is a wrapper
;;    around eieio.  Therefore, persistent-soft should probably be
;;    rewritten to use eieio directly or recast as a patch to pcache.
;;
;; TODO
;;
;;    Notice and delete old data files.
